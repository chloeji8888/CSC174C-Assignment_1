# CSC174C-Assignment_1
## Part One:
1. [3 points] Hermite spline class: ##line 282
2. [3 points] Add points & set point & set tangent ##line 220 
3. [3 points] Arc length ##line 365
4. [2 points] Load a spine from the input text and export the current spine to the output text. ##line 271 - line 316
5. [4 points] Spline drawing when click Draw  ##line 265

## Part Two:
1. [3 points] Particle system : Create a particle system ##line 341 line 404 
2. [2 points] Script-based commands: ##line 218
3. [2 points] Forward Euler ##line 577
4. [2 points] Symplectic Euler ##line 568
5. [2 points] Verlet ##line 586
6. [2 points] Ground collision forces and gravity ## line 518 ## line 410
7. [2 points] Particle and spring drawing #line 144 line 154 line 498 

## Part Three:
1. [4 points] Create and draw the trajectory of the top particle of the chain, as was done in Part 1, and move
the top particle of the chain along it. ## line40 - ##line 85
2. [4 points] Simulate and draw the chain. ##line 59 
3. [2 points] The overall drawing quality. No shadow, reflection, or texture are required. A simple yet clear
demonstration will suffice.
